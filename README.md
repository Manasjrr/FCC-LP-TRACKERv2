## Overview

**FCC-LP-TRACKERv2** is the official Discord bot of the **FCC community**, designed to track League of Legends Solo/Duo Queue ranked games for a list of monitored players. Built and maintained by **Manas**.

It automatically detects new matches, posts win/loss alerts in designated channels, and provides detailed statistics, rank history, LP graphs, and weekly recaps — all from Discord slash commands.
